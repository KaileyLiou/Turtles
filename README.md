# Sea Turtles Website

This is a website made with SvelteKit about endangered sea turtles. The title on the home page changes color when it is hovered over, and there are also facts that automatically change every 3 seconds.

There is a facts panel, and after users cycle through all the facts, a button is revealed to unlock the interactive page. 

The interactive page has a quiz testing users on facts about sea turtles. There is also a dynamic turtle swimming back and forth. To do this, I used keyframes with translations and rotations. When a user hovers over the turtle, it glows. I did this using a CSS hover effect with brightness.

The random chance rare event I incorporated in my project is confetti. If a user gets all four questions correct on the quiz, confetti will pop. 

My project is also responsive and works on mobile devices.

I struggled with using SvelteKit to code and ran into several errors that took a lot of time to debug.
